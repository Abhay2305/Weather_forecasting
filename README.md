## Project Overview

The Weather Forecasting project leverages historical weather data to predict future weather conditions. Using a combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models, the project aims to provide accurate weather forecasts.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is obtained from reliable sources such as:
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
- Meteorological agencies
- Online weather data repositories

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install these packages using pip:

pip install prophet

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Weather_Forecasting.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Weather_Forecasting
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Weather_forecasting.ipynb
    ```

5. Run the notebook cells to execute the analysis and forecasting.
